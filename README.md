# New Favorite Songs

A React-redux application that uses D3 to visualize data on songs you like, and songs you may like in the future!

### Setup

NOTE: In order to get this working locally, you MUST set up the API locally as well! Otherwise, you will not be able to log in with Spotify and get data on your favorite tracks. You can fork and clone the API (written in Flask) [here](https://github.com/mmmaaatttttt/new-favorite-songs-api).

This app is created with [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), so once your server is set up, getting the front-end working should be a breeze. Fork and clone this repository, and cd into the directory:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Enjoy!
